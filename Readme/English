# 3D Google Dinosaur in Unity

3D is the reincarnation of the classic browser dinosaur from Google Chrome, implemented on the Unity game engine. Run, jump and dodge cacti in a new 3D perspective!


## 🦖 About the project

This project is my interpretation of the famous mini—game "Dino Runner", which appears in Chrome when there is no internet connection. The main goal is to transfer the simple but addictive gameplay to a 3D space, preserving the spirit of the original, but adding a new visual dimension.
